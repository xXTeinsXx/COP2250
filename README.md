## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves to:
- Document my **progress** and **development** as a Java programmer.
- Demonstrate my **understanding** of core programming concepts.
- Create a **foundation** for more advanced software development and future coursework.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 17+)**
- **VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA** (for coding environment)
- **Git / GitHub** (for version control)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Each chapter is organized neatly into its respective folder.
- Files are named clearly to reflect the concepts demonstrated.
- Comments are included in most files to explain functionality and reasoning.

---

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Add mini-projects like a **small banking system**, **text-based adventure game**, or **simple GUI applications** after the course is complete.
- Expand the **File I/O** section with CSV file parsing examples.
- Start integrating **unit testing** with JUnit in future Java projects.
